# lab-2-Road-Trip
## Objective:

- Create a road trip summary
- Practice manipulating different variable types, practice formatting and justification

## Prep:

- Make sure you have read chapters 7 and 8 on variables, and type systems. 

## Steps:

1. Clone the repository from the GitHub classroom assignment
2. Create the program that looks like this: First gather information from the user (variable types and conversions are for you to discover). Then make the necessary calculations. Displayed numbers should formatted to no more than 2 decimal places, and your columns should align nicely (formatting and justification are for you to discover)

3. You are free to collect more information and display more information if you would like, but it must include at least the items displayed. 

4. Once finished, commit and push your code changes to GitHub Classroom.

5. Sign off with me to demonstrate your code.
